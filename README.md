# notes
 I been working as a FE programmer form years,during the days,there are no blogs and notes had been token. 
however,this is quite a bad habit. I have done projects and solved some problems,with days gone by,some 
solutions which were settled and made clear may become forgotten,and some links in my bookmark which helped
me were missing and gone.So, writting down somewhere will help recall the solution quick and efficient
